Is there a delay to be added in all communications?

Where is the bird launcher?

How do we decide which one is the closest pig?

How will a pig estimate the landing cell?

If a pig knows only its own position, how will it know which nearby cells are empty
 (so as to select one to move to)?

How are multiple pigs affected by a launch?

How do we start N instances of Pigs? (Learn more of RMI)

Which machine will read the configuration file?

Can we specify the list of neighbors for each pig in the configuration file?

If the address of a pig is stored within the pig, then does a pig know the addresses of the neighbors as well?

If there are 6 pigs, what should be the grid size and how many stones should be added

In which direction will the pig fall? Randomly out of all (3/5/8) neighbor cells?

Can a pig fall in a direction of its choice, or is it a random selection among all (3/5/8) neighboring cells?

Does take_shelter(pigID) mean that the pig who is getting affected by a bird strike will call
take_shelter with its own pigID?

Since you know only the IDs of pigs within your networking neighbors, how will a pig call take_shelter(pigID)
for saving its physical neighbors? Shouldn't it be take_shelter(row,col) for all row,cols around that pig?

Why is was_hit() required if the status of a pig can simply be returned in status(pigID)?

Piazza Doubts:
Can the network configuration be specified defensively, or should it be specified randomly?
Should the network configuration be specified without knowledge of the physical location of the pigs?
