Broadcast landing coordinates to neighbors

Given: N pigs as input

Positions of pigs vs. their network neighbors is totally different

Prior to EACH bird launch, assign positions to pigs --> The game is only for a single launch
Refresh otherwise

JSON Inputs
	N number of pigs
	No. of stones
	Grid size (nxm)
	Address of each pig
	Neighbors of each pig
	hop delay
	hop count

A pig is attacked by a bird if:
	If bird ETA < total time taken by all hops to reach a pig
	If all (3/5/8) neighboring cells are blocked

A pig is killed:
	If attacked by a bird (see above)
	If hurt by a neighboring pig
	If hurt by a neighboring stone

Since I am my neighbor's neighbor, I shouldn't be given my own message back during flood DFS messaging

If a pig is killed by a neighboring stone, then it will propogate its impact (similar to a bird attack)

Direction of falling of a pig (?) and stone, should be random for all (3/5/8) neighboring cells

Wait for T ms before sending the next flood DFS message

EXTRA:
If all (3/5/8) neighboring cells of a pig are blocked, then try to adjust all pigs on the map
so as to avoid a hit
